OKD adds developer and operations-centric tools on top of Kubernetes to enable rapid application development, easy deployment and scaling, and long-term lifecycle maintenance for small and large teams. OKD is also referred to as Origin in GitHub and in the documentation. OKD makes launching Kubernetes on any cloud or bare metal a snap, simplifies running and updating clusters, and provides all of the tools to make your containerized-applications succeed. Features \u00b6 A fully automated distribution of Kubernetes on all major clouds and bare metal, OpenStack, and other virtualization providers Easily build applications with integrated service discovery and persistent storage. Quickly and easily scale applications to handle periods of increased demand. Support for automatic high availability, load balancing, health checking, and failover. Access to the Operator Hub for extending Kubernetes with new, automated lifecycle capabilities Developer centric tooling and console for building containerized applications on Kubernetes Push source code to your Git repository and automatically deploy containerized applications. Web console and command-line client for building and monitoring applications. Centralized administration and management of an entire stack, team, or organization. Create reusable templates for components of your system, and iteratively deploy them over time. Roll out modifications to software stacks to your entire organization in a controlled fashion. Integration with your existing authentication mechanisms, including LDAP, Active Directory, and public OAuth providers such as GitHub. Multi-tenancy support, including team and user isolation of containers, builds, and network communication. Allow developers to run containers securely with fine-grained controls in production. Limit, track, and manage the developers and teams on the platform. Integrated container image registry, automatic edge load balancing, and full spectrum monitoring with Prometheus. What can I run on OKD? \u00b6 OKD is designed to run any Kubernetes workload. It also assists in building and developing containerized applications through the developer console. For an easier experience running your source code, Source-to-Image (S2I) allows developers to simply provide an application source repository containing code to build and run. It works by combining an existing S2I-enabled container image with application source to produce a new runnable image for your application. You can see the full list of Source-to-Image builder images and it's straightforward to create your own . Some of our available images include: Ruby Python Node.js PHP Perl WildFly MySQL MongoDB PostgreSQL MariaDB What sorts of security controls does OpenShift provide for containers? \u00b6 OKD runs with the following security policy by default: Containers run as a non-root unique user that is separate from other system users They cannot access host resources, run privileged, or become root They are given CPU and memory limits defined by the system administrator Any persistent storage they access will be under a unique SELinux label, which prevents others from seeing their content These settings are per project, so containers in different projects cannot see each other by default Regular users can run Docker, source, and custom builds By default, Docker builds can (and often do) run as root. You can control who can create Docker builds through the builds/docker and builds/custom policy resource. Regular users and project admins cannot change their security quotas. Many containers expect to run as root (and therefore edit all the contents of the filesystem). The Image Author's guide gives recommendations on making your image more secure by default: Don't run as root Make directories you want to write to group-writable and owned by group id 0 Set the net-bind capability on your executables if they need to bind to ports < 1024 If you are running your own cluster and want to run a container as root, you can grant that permission to the containers in your current project with the following command: # Gives the default service account in the current project access to run as UID 0 (root) oc adm add-scc-to-user anyuid -z default See the security documentation more on confining applications.","title":"About"},{"location":"about/#about-okd","text":"OKD is the community distribution of Kubernetes optimized for continuous application development and multi-tenant deployment.

OKD is the Origin Community Distribution of Kubernetes that is upstream to Red Hat\u2019s OpenShift Container Platform. It is built around a core of OCI containers and Kubernetes container cluster management. OKD is augmented by application lifecycle management functionality and DevOps tooling. The OKD Working Group's purpose is to discuss, give guidance to, and enable collaboration on current development efforts for OKD, Kubernetes, and related CNCF projects. The OKD Working Group will also include the discussion of shared community goals for OKD 4 and beyond. Additionally, the Working Group will produce supporting materials and best practices for end-users and will provide guidance and coordination for CNCF projects working within the SIG's scope. The OKD Working Group is independent of both Fedora and the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). The OKD Working Group is a community sponsored by Red Hat. Mission \u00b6 The mission of the OKD Working Group is: To collaborate on areas related to developing, deploying, managing, and operating OKD. To develop informational resources like guides, tutorials, and white papers to give the community an understanding of best practices, trade-offs, and value adds as it relates to developing, deploying, and managing applications in cloud native environments. To identify suitable projects and gaps in the ecosystem for future collaboration and coordination with those projects. Areas considered in Scope \u00b6 The OKD Working Group focuses on the following end-user related topics of the lifecycle of cloud-native applications: Installation of OKD Integration with Fedora CoreOS. Other Linux distributions will be gated based on community interests and resource commitments and the establishment of Sub-Working Groups OKD delivery and release management OKD management and operations The Working Group will work on developing best practices, fostering collaboration between related projects, and working on improving tool interoperability. Additionally, the Working Group will propose new initiatives and projects when capability gaps in the current ecosystem are defined. The following, non-exhaustive, sample list of activities and deliverables are in-scope for the Working Group: Operator Centric Installer Definition and Documentation of requirements for running on Linux Identification of requirements Submission of code to upstream sources Development of Continuous Integration Education material to help provide guidance for the community Might include a summary of projects available in the community Definitions of implementations and patterns for best practices for delivering OKD Best practices for OKD management Areas considered out of Scope \u00b6 Anything not explicitly considered in the scope above. Example include: Development of any Linux distribution or variant Initiation of new open source projects Definition of standards for components like container images other infrastructure-level building blocks of cloud-native applications Governance \u00b6 Operations \u00b6 The OKD Working Group is run and managed by the following chairs: Red Hat Community Development Liaison - Diane Mueller (Red Hat) External to Red Hat - Jaime Magiera (UMich) Red Hat Engineering Liaison - Vadim Rutkovsky (Red Hat) Fedora CoreOS Engineering Liaison - Timoth\u00e9e Ravier (Red Hat) Note The referenced names and chair positions will be edited in-place as chairs are added, removed, or replaced. See the roles of chairs section for more information. A dedicated git repository will be the authoritative archive for membership list, code, documentation, and decisions made. The repository, along with this charter, will be hosted at github.com/openshift/community. The mailing list at groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/okd-wg will be used as a place to call for and publish group decisions, and to hold discussions in general. Working Group Membership \u00b6 All active members of the Working Group are listed in the MEMBERS.md file with their name. New members can apply for membership by creating an Issue or Pull Request on the repository on GitHub indicating their desire to join. Membership can be surrendered by creating an Issue stating this desire, or by creating a Pull Request to remove the own name from the members list. Decision Process \u00b6 This group will seek consensus decisions. After public discussion and consideration of different opinions, the Chair and/or Co-Chair will record a decision and summarize any objections. All WG members who have joined the GitHub group at least 21 days prior to the vote are eligible to vote. This is to prevent people from rallying outside supporters for their desired outcome. When the group comes to a decision in a meeting, the decision is tentative. Any group participant may object to a decision reached at a meeting within 7 days of publication of the decision on the GitHub Issue and/or mailing list. That decision must then be confirmed on the GitHub Issue via a Call for Agreement. The Call for Agreement, when a decision is required, will be posted as a GitHub Issue or Pull Request and must be announced on the mailing list. It is an instrument to reach a time-bounded lazy consensus approval and requires a voting period of no less than 7 days to be defined (including a specific date and time in UTC). Each Call for Agreement will be considered independently, except for elections of Chairs. The Chairs will submit all Calls for Agreement that are not vague, unprofessional, off-topic, or lacking sufficient detail to determine what is being agreed. In the event that a Call for Agreement falls under the delegated authority or within a chartered Sub-Working Group, the Call for Agreement must be passed through the Sub-Working Group before receiving Working Group consideration. A Call for Agreement may require quorum of Chairs under the circumstances outlined in the Charter and Governing Documents section. A Call for Agreement is mandatory when: A Chair determines that the topic requires a Call for Agreement. When petitioned by members of the Working Group and submitted to the Chairs to call a vote unless rejected for cause. Technical decisions that add, remove, or change dependencies and requirements. Revoke a previous decision made by the Call for Agreement process. Approval of a Sub-Working Group when such SWG has any delegated authority. Once the Call for Agreement voting period has elapsed, all votes are counted, with at least a 51% majority of votes needed for consensus. A Chair will then declare the agreement \u201caccepted\u201d or \u201cdeclined\u201d, ending the Call for Agreement. Once rejected, a Call for Agreement must be revised before re-submission for a subsequent vote. All rejected Calls for Agreement will be reported to the Working Group as rejected. Charter and Governing Documents \u00b6 The Working Group may, from time to time, adopt or amend its Governing Documents and Charter, using a modified Call for Agreement process: A quorum of at least 51% of active Working Group Members must vote. A quorum of 3 Chairs is needed Two-thirds of the voting quorum must approve the proposal. A majority of Chairs must approve the proposal. A public notice period of no less than 14 days from the Call for Agreement proposing the change must elapse before voting begins. Any Call for Agreement that follows this process is considered a Governing Document. For initial approval of this Charter via Call for Agreement all members are eligible to vote, even those that have been a member for less than 21 days. This Charter will be approved if there is a majority of positive votes. Organizational Roles \u00b6 Role of Chairs \u00b6 The primary role of Chairs is to run operations and the governance of the group. The Chairs are responsible for: Setting the agenda for meetings. Extending discussion via asynchronous communication to be inclusive of members who cannot attend a specific meeting time. Scheduling discussing of proposals that have been submitted. Asking for new proposals to be made to address an identified need. Oversee disciplinary action for members. The Chairs have the authority to declare a member inactive and expel members for cause. Chairs will serve for one-year revolving terms and will be approved using the Condorcet Method . Upon the expiration of a Chair\u2019s term, it will continue for another year, unless challenged. The terms for founding Chairs start on the approval of this charter. When no candidate has submitted their name for consideration, the current Chairs may appoint an acting Chair until a candidate comes forward. Chairs must be active members. Any inactivity, disability, or ineligibility results in immediate removal. Chairs may be removed by petition to the Working Group through the Call for Agreement process outlined above. Additional Chairs may be added so long as the existing number of Chairs is odd. These Chairs are added using a Call for Agreement. Extra Chairs enjoy the same rights, responsibilities, and obligations of a Chartered Chair. Upon vacancy of an Extra Chair, it may be filled by appointment by the remaining Chairs, or a majority vote of the Working Group until the term naturally expires. In the event that an even number of Chairs exist and vote situation arises, the Chairs will randomly select one chair to abstain. Role of Sub-Working Groups \u00b6 Each Sub-Working Group (SWG) must have a Chair working as an active sponsor. Under the mandate of the Working Group, each SWG will have the autonomy to establish their own charter, membership rules, meeting times, and management processes. Each SWG will also have the authority to make in-scope decisions as delegated by the Working Group. SWGs are required to submit their agreed Charter to the Working Group for information and archival. The Chairs can petition for dissolution of an inactive or hostile SWG by Call for Agreement. Once dissolved the SWG\u2019s delegated Charter and outstanding authority to make decisions is immediately revoked. The Chairs may then take any required action to restrict access to Working Group Resources. No SWG will have authority with regards to this Charter or other OKD Working Group Governing Documents.","title":"Charter"},{"location":"charter/#okd-working-group-charter","text":"v1.1 2019-09-21","title":"OKD Working Group Charter"},{"location":"charter/#introduction","text":"The charter describes the operations of the OKD Working Group (OKD WG).

When no candidate has submitted their name for consideration, the current Chairs may appoint an acting Chair until a candidate comes forward. Chairs must be active members. Any inactivity, disability, or ineligibility results in immediate removal. Chairs may be removed by petition to the Working Group through the Call for Agreement process outlined above. Additional Chairs may be added so long as the existing number of Chairs is odd. These Chairs are added using a Call for Agreement. Extra Chairs enjoy the same rights, responsibilities, and obligations of a Chartered Chair. Upon vacancy of an Extra Chair, it may be filled by appointment by the remaining Chairs, or a majority vote of the Working Group until the term naturally expires. In the event that an even number of Chairs exist and vote situation arises, the Chairs will randomly select one chair to abstain.","title":"Role of Chairs"},{"location":"charter/#role-of-sub-working-groups","text":"Each Sub-Working Group (SWG) must have a Chair working as an active sponsor.

If you have a suggested question or a suggested improvement to an answer, please feel free to reach out. What are the relations with OCP project? Is OKD4 an upstream of OCP? \u00b6 In 3.x release time OKD was used as an upstream project for Openshift Container Platform. OKD could be installed on Fedora/CentOS/RHEL and used CentOS based images to install the cluster. OCP, however, could be installed only on RHEL and its images were rebuilt to be RHEL-based. Universal Base Image project has enabled us to run RHEL-based images on any platform, so the full image rebuild is no longer necessary, allowing OKD4 project to reuse most images from OCP4. There is another critical part of OCP - Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS. Although RHCOS is an open source project (much like RHEL8) it's not a community-driven project. As a result, OKD workgroup has made a decision to use Fedora CoreOS - open source and community-driven project - as a base for OKD4. This decision allows end-users to modify all parts of the cluster using prepared instructions. It should be noted that OKD4 is being automatically built from OCP4 ci stream , so most of the tests are happening in OCP CI and being mirrored to OKD. As a result, OKD4 CI doesn't have to run a lot of tests to ensure the release is valid. These relationships are more complex than \"upstream/downstream\", so we use \"sibling distributions\" to describe its state. How stable is OKD4? \u00b6 OKD4 builds are being automatically tested by release-controller . Release is rejected if either installation, upgrade from previous version or conformance test fails. Test results determine the upgrade graph, so for instance, if upgrade tests passed for beta5->rc edge, clusters on beta5 can be directly updated to rc release, bypassing beta6. The OKD stable version is released bi-weekly, following Fedora CoreOS schedule, client tools are uploaded to Github and images are mirrored to Quay. Can I run a single node cluster? \u00b6 Currently, single-node cluster installations cannot be deployed directly by the 4.7 installer. This is a known issue . Single-node cluster installations do work with the 4.8 nightly installer builds. As an alternative, if OKD version 4.7 is needed, you may have luck with Charro Gruver's OKD 4 Single Node Cluster instructions . You can also use Code Ready Containers (CRC) to run a single-node cluster on your desktop. What to do in case of errors? \u00b6 If you experience problems during installation you must collect the bootstrap log bundle, see instructions If you experience problems post installation, collect data of your cluster with: oc adm must-gather See documentation for more information. Upload it to a file hoster and send the link to the developers (Slack channel, ...) During installation the SSH key is required. It can be used to SSH onto the nodes later on - ssh core@<node ip> Where do I seek support? \u00b6 OKD is a community-supported distribution, Red Hat does not provide commercial support of OKD installations. Contact us on Slack: Workspace: Kubernetes, Channel: #openshift-dev (for developer communication) Workspace: Kubernetes, Channel: #openshift-users (for users ) See https://openshift.tips/ for useful Openshift tips Where can I find upgrades? \u00b6 https://amd64.origin.releases.ci.openshift.org/ Warning Nightly builds (from 4.x.0-0.okd ) are pruned every 72 hours. If your cluster uses these images, consider mirroring these files to a local registry. Builds from the stable-4 stream are not removed. How can I upgrade my cluster to a new version? \u00b6 Find a version where a tested upgrade path is available from your version for on https://amd64.origin.releases.ci.openshift.org/ Upgrade options: Preferred ways: Web Console: Home -> Overview -> Tab: Cluster, Card: Overview -> View settings -> Update Status Shell: Upgrades to latest available version oc adm upgrade Last resort : Upgrade to a certain version (will ignore the update graph!) oc adm upgrade --force --allow-explicit-upgrade = true --to-image = registry.ci.openshift.org/origin/release:4.4.0-0.okd-2020-03-16-105308 This will take a while; the upgrade may take several hours.

OKD could be installed on Fedora/CentOS/RHEL and used CentOS based images to install the cluster. OCP, however, could be installed only on RHEL and its images were rebuilt to be RHEL-based. Universal Base Image project has enabled us to run RHEL-based images on any platform, so the full image rebuild is no longer necessary, allowing OKD4 project to reuse most images from OCP4. There is another critical part of OCP - Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS. Although RHCOS is an open source project (much like RHEL8) it's not a community-driven project. As a result, OKD workgroup has made a decision to use Fedora CoreOS - open source and community-driven project - as a base for OKD4. This decision allows end-users to modify all parts of the cluster using prepared instructions. It should be noted that OKD4 is being automatically built from OCP4 ci stream , so most of the tests are happening in OCP CI and being mirrored to OKD. As a result, OKD4 CI doesn't have to run a lot of tests to ensure the release is valid. These relationships are more complex than \"upstream/downstream\", so we use \"sibling distributions\" to describe its state.","title":"What are the relations with OCP project? Is OKD4 an upstream of OCP?"},{"location":"faq/#how-stable-is-okd4","text":"OKD4 builds are being automatically tested by release-controller . Release is rejected if either installation, upgrade from previous version or conformance test fails. Test results determine the upgrade graph, so for instance, if upgrade tests passed for beta5->rc edge, clusters on beta5 can be directly updated to rc release, bypassing beta6.

The day will start with all attendees together in the \u2018main stage\u2019 area for 2 hours where we will give an short welcome and describe the logistics for the day, give a brief introduction to OKD4 itself then walk thru a install deployment to vSphere using UPI approach along with a few other more universal best practices such as DNS/DHCP server configuration) that apply to all deployment targets. Then we will break into tracks specific to the deployment target platforms for deep dive demos with Q/A, try and answer any questions you have about your specific deployment target's configurations, identify any missing pieces in the documentation and triage the documentation as we go. There will be 4 track break-out rooms set-up for 3 hours of deployment walk throughs and Q/A with session leads: vSphere/UPI - lead by Jaime Magiera (UMich) and Josef Meier (Rohde & Schwarz) Bare Metal/UPI - lead by Andrew Sullivan (Red Hat) and Jason Pittman (Red Hat) Single Node Cluster - lead by Charro Gruver (Red Hat) and Bruce Link (BCIT) Home Lab Setup - lead by Craig Robinson (Red Hat) and Sri Ramanujam (Datto) Our goal is to triage our existing community documentation, identify any short comings and encourage your participation in the OKD-Working Group 's testing of the installation and upgrade processes for each OKD release. This is community event NOT meant as a substitute for Red Hat technical support. There is no admission or ticket charge for OKD-Working Group events.

As Red Hat engineers working on OpenShift, we have many tools at our disposal to research cluster failures and to report our findings to our colleagues. We would like to share some of our experiences, techniques, and tools with the wider OKD community in the hopes of inspiring others to investigate these areas. As part of our daily activities we spend a significant amount of time investigating bugs, and also failures in our release images and testing systems. As you might imagine, to accomplish this task we use many tools and pieces of tribal knowledge to understand not only the failures themselves, but the complexity of the build and testing infrastructures. As Kubernetes and OpenShift have grown, there has always been an organic growth of tooling and testing that helps to support and drive the development process forward. To fully understand the depths of these processes is to be actively following what is happening with the development cycle. This is not always easy for users who are also focused on delivering high quality service through their clusters. On 2 September, 2022, we had the opportunity to record a video of ourselves diving into the OKD release artifacts to show how we investigate failures in the continuous integration release pipeline. In this video we walk through the process of finding a failing release test, examining the Prow console , and then exploring the results that we find.

This cluster provides all the compute and storage I think I'll need for the foreseeable future, and the CPU, RAM, and storage can all be scaled vertically independently of each other. Not that I think I'll need to do that for a while. More detail into the deployment and my homelab's Terraform configuration can be found here . Hardware \u00b6 3 hyper-converged hypervisors Ryzen 5 3600 64 GiB RAM 3x 4TiB HDD 2x 500GiB SSD in RAID1 1x 256GiB NVME for boot disk 1 NUC I had laying around gathering dust Intel Core i3-5010U 16 GiB RAM 500GiB SSD Main cluster \u00b6 My hypervisors each host an identical workload. The total size of this cluster is 3 control plane nodes, and 9 worker nodes. So it splits very nicely three ways. Each hypervisor hosts 1 control plane VM and 3 worker VMs. 3 control plane nodes 4x CPU 10 GiB RAM 50 GiB disk 9 worker nodes 8x CPU 16 GiB RAM 50 GiB root disk 4 TiB HDD for workload use 1 bootstrap node (temporary, taken down after initial setup is complete) 4 vCPU 8 GiB RAM 120 GiB root disk Supporting infrastructure \u00b6 Networking \u00b6 OKD, and especially baremetal UPI OKD, requires a very specific network setup. You will most likely need something more flexible than your ISP's router to get everything fully configured. The documentation is very clear on the various DNS records and DHCP static allocations you will need to make, so I won't go into them here. However, there are a couple extra things that you may want to set for best results. In particular, I make sure that I have PTR records set up for all my cluster nodes. This is extremely important as the nodes need a correct PTR record set up for them to auto-discover their hostname. Clusters typically do not set themselves up properly if there are hostname collisions! API load balancer \u00b6 I run a separate smaller VM on the NUC as a single-purpose load balancer appliance, running HAProxy. 1 load balancer VM 2x vCPU 256MiB RAM 10GiB disk The HAProxy config is straightforward. I adapted mine from the example config file created by the ocp4-helpernode playbook. Deployment \u00b6 I create the VMs on the hypervisors using Terraform. The Terraform Libvirt provider is very, very cool. It's also used by openshift-install for its Libvirt-based deployments, so it supports everything needed to deploy OKD nodes. Most importantly, I can use Terraform to supply the VMs with their Ignition configs, which means I don't have to worry about passing kernel args manually or setting up a PXE server to get things going like the official OKD docs would have you do. Terraform also makes it easy to tear down the cluster and reset in case something goes wrong. Post-Bootstrap One-Time Setup \u00b6 Storage with Rook and Ceph \u00b6 I deploy a Ceph cluster into OKD using Rook. The Rook configuration deploys OSDs on top of the 4TiB HDDs assigned to each worker. I deploy an erasure-coded CephFS pool (6+2) for RWX workloads and a 3x replica block pool for RWO workloads. Monitoring and Alerting \u00b6 OKD comes with a very comprehensive monitoring and alerting suite, and it would be a shame not to take advantage of it. I set up an Alertmanager webhook to send any alerts to a small program I wrote that posts the alerts to Discord . I also deploy a Prometheus + Grafana set up into the cluster that collects metrics from the various hypervisors and supporting infrastructure VMs. I use Grafana's built-in Discord alerting mechanism to post those alerts. LoadBalancer with MetalLB \u00b6 MetalLB is a piece of fantastic software that allows on-prem or otherwise non-public-cloud Kubernetes clusters to enjoy the luxury of LoadBalancer type services. It's dead simple to set up and makes you feel you're in a real datacenter. I deploy several workloads that don't use standard HTTP and so can't be deployed behind a Route . Without MetalLB, I wouldn't be able to deploy these workloads on OKD at all but with it, I can! Software I Run \u00b6 I maintain an ansible playbook that handles deploying my workloads into the cluster. I prefer Ansible over other tools like Helm because it has more robust capabilities to store secrets, I find its templating capabilities more flexible and powerful than Helm's (especially when it comes to inlining config files into config maps or creating templated Dockerfiles for BuildConfigs), and because I am already familiar with Ansible and know how it works. paperless-ng - A document organizer that uses machine learning to automatically classify and organize bitwarden_rs - Password manager Jellyfin - Media management Samba - I joined a StatefulSet to my AD domain and it serves an authenticated SMB share Netbox - Infrastructure management tool Quassel - IRC bouncer Ukulele - Bot that plays music into Discord channels RPM and deb package repos for internal packages","title":"Sri's homelab"},{"location":"guides/sri/#sris-overkill-homelab-setup","text":"This document lays out the resources used to create my completely-overkill homelab.

OKD is made up of many components bundled into a release. You can find the exact commit for each component included in a release using the oc adm release info command with the --commit-urls option, as outlined in the overview section. To make a change to OKD you need to: Identify the component(s) that needs to be changed Clone/fork the git repository (you can choose to fork the exact commit used to create the image referenced by the OKD release or a newer version of the source) Make the change Build the image and push to a container registry that the OKD cluster will be able to access Run the modified container on a cluster Building images \u00b6 Most component repositories contain a Dockerfile, so building the image is as simple as podman build or docker build depending on your container tool of choice. Some component repositories contain a Makefile, so building the image can be done using the Makefile, typically with make build First thing to do is to replace the FROM images in Dockerfile.rhel7 .

There is an effort to update the Dockerfiles with publically available images. Example Scenario \u00b6 Modify console-operator to have a link to the community site okd.io instead of docs.okd.io add to pre-existing cluster build a custom release to include the modified console-operator, then install a new cluster will custom release To complete the scenario the following steps need to be performed: Fork the console-operator repository Clone the new fork locally: git clone https://github.com/<username>/console-operator.git create new branch from master (or main): git switch -c <branch name> Make needed modifications. Commit/squash as needed. Maintainers like to see 1 commit rather than several.

You should also check the repo README.md file or any documentation, typically in a doc folder, as there may be some repo specific details Question Are there any special repos unique to OKD that need specific mention here, such as machine config? Running the modified image on a cluster \u00b6 An OKD release contain a specific set of images and there are operators that ensure that only the correct set of images are running a cluster, so you need to do some specific actions to be able to run your modified image on a cluster. You can do this by: configuring an existing cluster to run a modified image create a new installer containing your image then creating a new cluster with the modified installer Running on an existing cluster \u00b6 The Cluster Version Operator watches the deployments and images related to the core OKD services to ensure that only valid images are running in the core. This prevents you from changing any of the core images. If you want to replace an image you need to scale the Cluster Version Operator down to 0 replicas: oc scale --replicas = 0 deployment/cluster-version-operator -n openshift-cluster-version Some images, such as the Cluster Cloud Controller Manager Operator and the Machine API Operator need additional steps to be able to make changes, but these typically have a docs folder containing additional information about how to make changes to these images.

Previously the site used an HTML based framework, which resulted in content not being frequently updated as there was a steep learning curve. All content on the site should be created using Markdown. To ensure content is maintainable going forward only markdown features outlined below should be used to create site content. If you wish to use additional components on a page then please contact the documentation working group to discuss your requirements before creating a pull request containing additional components. MkDocs includes the ability to create custom page templates. This facility has been used to create a customized home page for the site. If any other pages require a custom layout or custom features, then a page template should be used so the content can remain in Markdown. Creation of custom page templates should be discussed with the documentation working group. Changing content \u00b6 MkDocs supports standard Markdown syntax and a set Markdown extensions provided by plugins. The exact Markdown syntax supported is based on the python implementation . MkDocs is configured using the mkdocs.yml file in the root of the git repository. The mkdoc.yml file defines the top level navigation for the site. The level of indentation is configurable (this requires the theme to support this feature) with Markdown headings, levels 2 ( ## ) and 3 ( ### ) being used for the in-page navigation on the right of the page. Standard Markdown features \u00b6 The following markdown syntax is used within the documentation Syntax Result # Title heading - you can create up to 6 levels of headings by adding additional # characters, so ### is a level 3 heading **text** will display the word text in bold *text* will display the word text in italic `code` inline code block ```shell ... ``` multi-line (Fenced) code block 1. list item ordered list - unordered list item unordered list --- horizontal break HTML can be embedded in Markdown, but embedded HTML should not be used in the documentation. All content should use Markdown with the permitted extensions. Indentation \u00b6 MkDocs uses 4 spaces for tabs, so when indenting code ensure you are working with tabs set to 4 spaces rather than 2, which is commonly used. When using some features of Markdown indentation is used to identify blocks. 1. Ubiquity EdgeRouter ER-X - runs DHCP (embedded), custom DNS server via AdGuard ![ pic ]( ./img/erx.jpg ){width=80%} In the code block above you will see the unordered list item is indented, so it aligns with the content of the ordered list (rather than aligning with the number of the ordered list). The image is also indented so it too aligns with the ordered list text. Many of the Markdown elements can be nested and indentation is used to define the nesting relationship. If you look down on this page at the Information boxes section, the example shows an example of nesting elements and the Markdown tab shows how indentation is being used to identify the nesting relationships. Links within MkDocs generated content \u00b6 MkDocs will warn of any internal broken links, so it is important that links within the documentation are recognized as internal links. a link starting with a protocol name, such as http or https, is an external link a link starting with / is an external link. This is because MkDocs generated content can be embedded into another web application, so links can point outside of the MkDocs generated site but hosted on the same website a link starting with a file name (including the .md extension) or relative directory (../directory/filename.md) is an internal link and will be verified by MkDocs Information Internal links should be to the Markdown file (with .md extension). When the site is generated the filename will be automatically converted to the correct URL As part of the build process a linkchecker application will check the generated html site for any broken links. You can run this linkchecker locally using the instructions. If any links in the documentation should be excluded from the link checker, such as links to localhost, then they should be added as a regex to the linkcheckerrc file, located in the root folder of the project - see linkchecker documentation for additional information Markdown Extensions used in OKD.io \u00b6 There are a number of Markdown extensions being used to create the site. See the mkdocs.yml file to see which extensions are configured. The documentation for the extensions can be found here Link configuration \u00b6 Links on the page or embedded images can be annotated to control the links and also the appearance of the links: Image \u00b6 Images are embedded in a page using the standard Markdown syntax ![description](URL) , but the image can be formatted with Attribute Lists . This is most commonly used to scale an image or center an image, e.g. ![ GitHub repo url ]( images/github-repo-url.png ){style=\"width: 80%\" .center } External Links \u00b6 External links can also use attribute lists to control behaviors, such as open in new tab or add a css class attribute to the generated HTML, such as external in the example below: [ MkDocs ]( http://mkdocs.org ){: target=\"_blank\" .external } Info You can embed an image as the description of a link to create clickable images that launch to another site: [![Image description](Image URL)](target URL \"hover text\"){: target=_blank} YouTube videos \u00b6 It is not possible to embed a YouTube video and have it play in place using pure markdown. You can use HTML within the markdown file to embed a video: < iframe width = \"100%\" height = \"500\" src = \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qh1zYW7BLxE&t=431s\" title = \"Building an OKD 4 Home Lab with special guest Craig Robinson\" frameborder = \"0\" allow = \"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen ></ iframe > Tabs \u00b6 Content can be organized into a set of horizontal tabs. === \"Tab 1\" Hello === \"Tab 2\" World produces : Tab 1 Hello Tab 2 World Information boxes \u00b6 The Admonition extension allows you to add themed information boxes using the !!! and ??? syntax: !!! note This is a note produces: Note This is a note and ??? note This is a collapsible note You can add a `+` character to force the box to be initially open `???+` produces a collapsible box: Note This is a collapsible note You can add a + character to force the box to be initially open ???+ You can override the title of the box by providing a title after the Admonition type.

To use inline you simply enclose the text using a single back quote ` character. So a command can be included using `oc get pods` and will create oc get pods When you want to include a block of code you use a fence , which is 3 back quote character at the start and end of the block. After the opening quotes you should also specify the content type contained in the block. ```shell oc get pods ``` which will produce: oc get pods Notice that the block automatically gets the copy to clipboard link to allow easy copy and paste. Every code block needs to identify the content. Where there is no content type, then text should be used to identify the content as plain text. Some of the common content types are shown in the table below. However, a full link of supported content types can be found here , where the short name in the documentation should be used. type Content shell Shell script content powershell Windows Power Shell content bat Windows batch file (.bat or .cmd files) json JSON content yaml YAML content markdown or md Markdown content java Java programming language javascript or js JavaScript programming language typescript or ts TypeScript programming language text Plain text content Advanced highlighting of code blocks \u00b6 There are some additional features available due to the highlight plugin installed in MkDocs. Full details can be found in the MkDocs Materials documentation . Line numbers \u00b6 You can add line numbers to a code block with the linenums directive. You must specify the starting line number, 1 in the example below: ``` javascript linenums=\"1\" <script> document.getElementById(\"demo\").innerHTML = \"My First JavaScript\"; </script> ``` creates 1 2 3 < script > document . getElementById ( \"demo\" ). innerHTML = \"My First JavaScript\" ; < /script> Info The line numbers do not get included when the copy to clipboard link is selected Spell checking \u00b6 This project uses cSpell to check spelling within the markdown. The configuration included in the project automatically excludes content in a code block, enclosed in triple back quotes ```. The configuration file also specifies that US English is the language used in the documentation, so only US English spellings should be used for words where alternate international English spellings exist. You can add words to be considered valid either within a markdown document or within the cspell configuration file, cspell.json , in the root folder of the documentation repository. Words defined within a page only apply to that page, but words added to the configuration file apply to the entire project. Adding local words \u00b6 You can add a list of words to be considered valid for spell checking purposes as a comment in a Markdown file. The comment has a specific format to be picked up by the cSpell tool: <!--- cSpell:ignore linkchecker linkcheckerrc mkdocs mkdoc --> here the words linkchecker , linkcheckerrc , mkdocs and mkdoc are specified as words to be accepted by the spell checker within the file containing the comment. Adding global words \u00b6 The cSpell configuration file cspell.json contains a list of words that should always be considered valid when spell checking. The list of words applies to all files being checked.","title":"Content guidelines"},{"location":"wg_docs/content/#site-content-maintainability","text":"The site has adopted Markdown as the standard way to create content for the site.

If running on Linux you can use Docker or Podman . If you have a node.js environment installed that includes the npm command then you can make use of the run scripts provided in the project to run the docker or podman commands The following commands all assume you are working in the root directory of your local git clone of your forked copy of the okd.io git repo. (your working directory should contain mkdocs.yml and package.json files) Warning If you are using Linux with SELinux enabled, then you need to configure your system to allow the local directory containing the cloned git repo to be mounted inside a container. The following commands will configure SELinux to allow this: (change the path to the location of your okd.io directory) sudo semanage fcontext -a -t container_file_t '/home/brian/Documents/projects/okd.io(/.*)?' sudo restorecon -Rv /home/brian/Documents/projects/okd.io Creating the container \u00b6 To create the container image on your local system choose the appropriate command from the list: if you are using the docker command on Linux, Mac OS or Windows: docker build -t mkdocs-build -f ./dev/Dockerfile . if you are using the podman command on Linux: podman build -t mkdocs-build -f ./dev/Dockerfile . if you have npm and use Docker on Linux, Mac OS or Windows: npm run docker-build-image if you have npm and use Podman on Linux: npm run podman-build-image This will build a local container image named mkdocs-build Live editing of the content \u00b6 To change the content of the web site you can use your preferred editing application. To see the changes you can run a live local copy of okd.io that will automatically update as you save local changes. Ensure you have the local container image, built in the previous step, available on your system then choose the appropriate command from the list: if you are using the docker command on Linux or Mac OS: docker run -it --rm --name mkdocs-serve -p 8000 :8000 -v ` pwd ` :/site mkdocs-build if you are using the podman command on Linux: podman run -it --rm --name mkdocs-serve -p 8000 :8000 -v ` pwd ` :/site mkdocs-build if you are on Windows using the docker command in Powershell: docker run -it - -rm - -name mkdocs-build -p 8000 : 8000 -v \" $( pwd ) :/site\" mkdocs-build if you are on Windows using the docker command in CMD prompt: docker run -it --rm --name mkdocs-build -p 8000:8000 -v %cd%:/site mkdocs-build if you have npm and use Docker on Linux or Mac OS: npm run docker-serve if you have npm on Windows: npm run win-docker-serve if you have npm and use Podman on Linux: npm run podman-serve You can now open a browser to localhost:8000 .

Editing on cluster There is a community operator available in the OperatorHub on OKD to install Eclipse Che, the upstream project for Red Hat CodeReady Workspaces. You can use Che to modify site content through your browser, with your OKD cluster hosting the workspace and developer environment. You need to have access to an OKD cluster and have the Che operator installed and an Che instance deployed and running. In your OKD console, you should have an applications link in the top toolbar. Open the Applications menu (3x3 grid icon) and select Che. This will open the Che application - Google Chrome is the supported browser and will give the best user experience. In the Che console side menu, select to Create Workspace , then in the Import from Git section add the URL of your fork of the okd.io git repository (should be similar to https://github.com/<user or org name>/okd.io.git ) then press Create & Open to start the workspace. After a short while the workspace will open ( the cluster has to download and start a number of containers, so the first run may take a few minutes depending on your cluster network access ). When the workspace is displayed you may have to wait a few seconds for the workspace to initialize and clone your git repo into the workspace. You may also get asked if you trust the author of the git repository, answer yes to this question. Your environment should then be ready to start work. The web based developer environment uses the same code base as Microsoft Visual Studio Code, so provides a similar user experience, but within your browser. Live editing of the content \u00b6 To change the content of the web site you can use the in browser editor provided by Che. To see the changes you can run a live local copy of okd.io that will automatically update as you save local changes. On the right side of the workspace window you should see 3 icons, hovering over them should reveal they are the Outline , Endpoints and Workspace . Clicking into the workspace, you should see a User Runtimes section with the option to open a new terminal, then 2 commands (Live edit and Build) and finally a link to launch MkDocs web site (initially this link will not work) To allow you to see your changes in a live site (where any change you save will automatically be updated on the site) click on the 1. Live edit link. This will launch a new terminal window where the mkdocs serve command will run, which provides a local live site. However, as you are running the development site on a cluster, the Che runtime automatically makes this site available to you. The MkDocs link now points to the site, but you will be asked if you want to open the site in a new tab or in Preview. Preview will add a 4th icon to the side toolbar and open the web site in the side panel. You can drag the side of the window to resize the browser view to allow you to edit on the left and view the results on the right of your browser window. If you have multiple monitors you may want to select to open the website in a new Tab or use the MkDocs link, then drag the browser tab on to a different monitor. By default, the Che environment auto-saves any file modification after half a second of no activity. You can alter this in the preferences section. When ever a file is saved the live site will update in the browser. When you finished editing simply close the terminal window running the Live edit script. This will stop the web server running the preview site. Build and validate the site \u00b6 The build script will create or update the static web site in the public directory - this is what will be created and published as the live site if you submit a pull request with your modifications. To run the build script simply click the 2. Build link in the Workspace panel. You should verify there are no spelling mistakes, by finding the last line of the CSpell output: CSpell: Files checked: 31, Issues found: 0 in 0 files Further down in the console output wil be the summary of the link checker: That's it. 662 links in 695 URLs checked. 0 warnings found. 0 errors found Any issues reported should be fixed before submitting a pull request to add your changes to the okd.io site. Local mkdocs and python tooling installation You can install MkDocs and associated plugins on your development system and run the tools locally: Install Python 3 on your system Install Node.js on your system Clone your fork of the okd.io repository cd into the local repo directory (./okd.io) Install the required python packages `pip install -r requirements.txt' Install the spell checker using command npm ci . If you want to use the cspell command on the command line, then you need to install it globally npm -g i cspell Note sudo command may be needed to install globally, depending on your system configuration You now have all the tools installed to be able to create the static HTML site from the markdown documents. The documentation for MkDocs provides full instructions for using MkDocs, but the important commands are: mkdocs build will build the static site. This must be run in the root directory of the repo, where mkdocs.yml is located. The static site will be created/updated in the public directory mkdocs serve will build the static site and launch a test server on http://localhost:8000 . Every time a document is modified the website will automatically be updated and any browser open will be refreshed to the latest. To check links in the built site ( mkdocs build must be run first), use the linkchecker, with command linkchecker -f linkcheckerrc --check-extern public . This command should be run in the root folder of the project, containing the linkcheckerrc file. To check spelling cspell docs/**/*.md should be run in the root folder of the project, containing the cspell.json file. There is also a convenience script ./build.sh in the root of the repository that will check spelling, build the site then run the link checker. You should verify there are no spelling mistakes, by finding the last line of the CSpell output: CSpell: Files checked: 31, Issues found: 0 in 0 files Similarly, the link checker creates a summary after checking the site: That's it. 662 links in 695 URLs checked. 0 warnings found. 0 errors found Any issues reported should be fixed before submitting a pull request to add your changes to the okd.io site.","title":"Setup environment"},{"location":"wg_docs/doc-env/#setting-up-a-documentation-environment","text":"To work on documentation and be able to view the rendered web site you need to create an environment, which comprises of: MkDocs with the Materials theme CSpell linkchecker Node.js Python 3 You can create the environment by : running the tooling within a container runtime, so you don't need to do any local installs if you have an Eclipse Che installation on an OKD cluster then you can make the changes using only a browser, with all the tooling running inside Che on the OKD cluster. installing the components on your local system Tooling within a container You can use a container to run MkDocs so no local installation is required, however you do need to have Docker Desktop installed if using Mac OS or Windows.
