# Documentation Subgroup

The Documentation working group is responsible for improving the OKD documentation.  Both the community documentation (this site) and the product documentation.

## Joining the group

The Documentation Subgroup is open to all.  You don't need to be invited to join, just attend on of the bi-weekly video calls:

- Agenda link : [Documentation working group agenda and meeting nodes](https://hackmd.io/lPScL-5bQa-utsuRlESf-Q?view#OKD-Working-Group---Documentation-Subgroup-Meetings-Ongoing){: target=_blank}

## Product Documentation

The [OKD product documentation](https://docs.okd.io){: target=_blank} is maintained in the same [git repository](https://github.com/openshift/openshift-docs/){: target=_blank} as Red Hat OpenShift product documentation, as they are sibling projects and largely share the same source code.

The process for making changes to the documentation is outlined in the [documentation section](../docs.md#product-documentation)

## Community Documentation

This site is the community documentation.  It is hosted on [github](https://github.com/openshift-cs/okd.io/){: target=_blank} and uses a static site generator to convert the Markdown documents in the git repo into this website.

Details of how to modify the site content is contained on the page [Modifying OKD.io](okd-io.md).
