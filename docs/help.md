# Help

There is no official product support for OKD as it is a community project. All assistance is provided by volunteers from the user community.

## How to ask for help

For questions or feedback, start a discussion on the [discussion forum](https://github.com/openshift/okd/discussions){: target=_blank} or reach us on [Kubernetes Slack on #openshift-users](https://kubernetes.slack.com/)

## Community Etiquette

As all assistance is provided by the community, you are reminded of the [code-of-conduct](community.md#code-of-conduct){: target=_blank} when asking a question or replying to a question.

Before starting a new discussion topic, do a search on the discussion forum to see if anyone else has already raised the same issue - then contribute to the existing discussion topic rather than starting a new topic.

When seeking help you should provide all the information a community volunteer may need to assist you.  The easier it is for a volunteer to understand your issue, the more likely they are to provide assistance.

This information should include:

- the version of OKD you are using
- the platform you are running on (and type of install - IPI / UPI)
- if you are following instructions and are having issues, a link to the instructions
- the [must gather logs](https://docs.okd.io/latest/support/gathering-cluster-data.html){: target=_blank} - these should be uploaded to a sharing site, such as [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/){: target=_blank} then a public link added to the discussion topic
- a description of the steps that can be used to recreate your issue, if applicable

Please do not tag people you see answering other questions to try to get a faster answer as it is anti-social.  We have an active community and it is up to individuals which questions they feel they want to respond to.

## Raising bugs

We are trying to do all the diagnostic work in the discussion forum rather than using issues for the OKD project.  If you are certain you have discovered a bug, then please raise an [issue](https://github.com/openshift/okd/issues){: target=_blank}, but if you are not sure if you have found a bug then use the discussion forum to discuss it.  If it turns out to be a bug, then the discussion topic can be converted to an issue.
