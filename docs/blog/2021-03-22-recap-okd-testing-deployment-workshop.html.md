## The OKD Working Group held a virtual community-hosted workshop on testing and deploying OKD4 on March 20th

On March 20th, [OKD-Working Group](https://groups.google.com/g/okd-wg) hosted a day-long event to bring together people from the OKD and related Open Source project communities to collaborate on testing and [documentation of the OKD 4 install and upgrade processes for the various platforms](https://github.com/elmiko/okd-deployment-configuration-guides) that people are deploying OKD 4 on as well to identify any issues with the current documentation for these processes and triage them together.

The day started with all attendees together in the ‘main stage’ area for 2 hours where community members gave an short welcome along with the following four presentations:

- [What is OKD4 (with a Release Update) - by Charro Gruver (Red Hat)](https://youtu.be/fOKve11GOJg)
- [Walk Thru of the OKD Release and Build Processes - Vadim Rutkovsky (Red Hat)](https://youtu.be/HmmV1mLRtbM)
- [Walk Thru of the OKD Deployment and Configuration Guides - Jamie Magiera (UMich)](https://youtu.be/-AwpvgbaMVg)
- [Best Practices such as DNS/DHCP server and Load Balancer Configuration) - Josef Meier (Rohde and Schwarz)](https://youtu.be/by6ZmwWC8bs)

Then attendees then broke into track sessions specific to the deployment target platforms for deep dive demos with live Q/A, answered as many questions as possible about that specific deployment target's configurations, attempted to identify any missing pieces in the documentation and triage the documentation as we went along.  

The 4 track break-out rooms set-up for 2.5 hours of deployment walk throughs and Q/A with session leads:

- [Automated Installation on vSphere UPI - lead by Jaime Magiera (UMich) and Josef Meier (Rohde & Schwarz)](https://youtu.be/vCoznRt3_2I)
- [Bare Metal/UPI - lead by Andrew Sullivan (Red Hat) and Jason Pittman (Red Hat)](https://youtu.be/eM_pYnf_xFw)
- [Single Node Cluster - lead by Charro Gruver (Red Hat) and Bruce Link (BCIT)](https://youtu.be/lI382l3u4fM)
- [Home Lab Setup - lead by Craig Robinson (Red Hat), Sri Ramanujam (Datto) and Vadim Rutkovsky(Red Hat)](https://youtu.be/nDDhguTZgLE)

Our goal was to triage our existing community documentation, identify any short comings and encourage your participation in the [OKD-Working Group](https://groups.google.com/g/okd-wg)'s testing of the installation and upgrade processes for each OKD release.
