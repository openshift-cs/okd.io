# CRC Build Subgroup

<!--- cSpell:ignore Charro Gruver -->

Code-Ready Containers is a cut down version of OKD, designed to run on a developer's machine, which would not have sufficient resources for a full installation of OKD.

The working group was established after a [live session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyGRaodl740){: target=_blank} where Red Hat's Charro Gruver walked through the build process for OKD CRC

The build process is currently manual, so the working group was established to automate the process and investigate options for creating a continuous integration setup to build and test OKD CRC.
