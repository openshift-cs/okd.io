<!--- cSpell:ignore roadmap -->

Built around a core of OCI container packaging and Kubernetes container cluster management, OKD is also augmented by application lifecycle management functionality and DevOps tooling. OKD provides a complete open source container application platform.

## OKD 4

```$ openshift-install create cluster```

Tons of amazing new features

Automatic updates not only for OKD but also for the host OS, k8s Operators are first class citizens, a fancy UI, and much much more

CodeReady Containers brings a minimal OpenShift 4 cluster to your local laptop or desktop computer! Download it here: CodeReady Containers for OKD Images

## What is OKD?

OKD is a **distribution of Kubernetes** optimized for continuous application development and multi-tenant deployment

OKD embeds Kubernetes and extends it with security and other integrated concepts

OKD adds **developer and operations-centric** tools on top of Kubernetes to enable rapid application development, easy deployment and scaling, and long-term lifecycle maintenance for small and large teams

OKD is also referred to as Origin in GitHub and in the documentation

OKD is a **sibling** Kubernetes distribution to **Red Hat OpenShift** | If you are looking for enterprise-level support, or information on partner certification, Red Hat also offers [Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform](https://www.openshift.com/){: target=_blank}

## Standardization through Containerization

Standards are powerful forces in the software industry. They can drive technology forward by bringing together the combined efforts of multiple developers, different communities, and even competing vendors.
