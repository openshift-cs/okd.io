# The OKD Working Group held a virtual community-hosted workshop on testing and deploying OKD4 on March 20th

On March 20th, [OKD-Working Group](https://groups.google.com/g/okd-wg hosted a day-long to bring together people from the OKD and related Open Source project communities to collaborate on testing and [documentation of the OKD 4 install and upgrade processes for the various platforms](https://github.com/elmiko/okd-deployment-configuration-guides) that people are deploying OKD 4 on as well to identify any issues with the current documentation for these processes and triage them together.

The day started with all attendees together in the ‘main stage’ area for 2 hours where community members gave an short welome along with the following four presentations:

[What is OKD4 (with a Release Update) - by Charro Gruver (Red Hat)](https://youtu.be/fOKve11GOJg)

[Best Practices such as DNS/DHCP server and Load Balancer Configuration) - Josef Meier (Rohde and Schwarz)](https://youtu.be/by6ZmwWC8bs)

Then attendees then broke into track sessions specific to the deployment target platforms for deep dive demos with live Q/A, answered as maany questions as possible about that specific deployment target's configurations, attempted to identify any missing pieces in the documentation and triage the documenation as we went along.  

The 4 track break-out rooms set-up for 2.5 hours of deployment walk thrus and Q/A with session leads:
